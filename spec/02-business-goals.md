# Business Goals & Vision

## Primary Goal

Provide a modern, code-first alternative to traditional installation wizards that enables developers to define installation workflows programmatically with full automation support.

## Core Principles

### 1. Code-First

- Strong typing and compile-time validation
- Version control friendly
- Full IntelliSense support

### 2. Automation-Friendly
- Works seamlessly in CI/CD pipelines
- Silent/unattended mode support
- Scriptable via code or configuration files
- No GUI dependencies for headless operation

### 3. Testable
- Full unit testing support for installation logic
- Mock-friendly interfaces
- Dry-run capability
- Validation without execution

### 4. Extensible
- Plugin architecture for custom steps
- Convention-based discovery
- Third-party integration support
- Template/preset system

### 5. Enterprise-Ready
